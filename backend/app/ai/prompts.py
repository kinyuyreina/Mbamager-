Mbamager Gemini Prompt Templates

Plain-string templates consumed by app/services/ai_service.py via `.format(...)`.
Every template instructs Gemini to respond with a single JSON object only (the
service calls Gemini with response_mime_type="application/json"), and every
call site in ai_service.py has a deterministic fallback if Gemini is
unavailable or returns something unusable — per Engineering Law 1, the AI
layer only ever produces suggestions; it never writes to the ledger directly.

Valid TransactionCategory / BudgetCategory enum values (see
app/models/transaction.py and app/constants/categories.py):
    INCOME_SALARY, INCOME_BUSINESS, INCOME_REMITTANCE,
    EXPENSE_FOOD, EXPENSE_UTILITIES, EXPENSE_HEALTH, EXPENSE_EDUCATION,
    EXPENSE_TRANSPORT, EXPENSE_COMMISSION, SAVINGS, INVESTMENT
